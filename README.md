# Recipe App

> The Recipe app keeps track of all your recipes, ingredients, and inventory. It will allow you to save ingredients, 
keep track of what you have, create recipes, and generate a shopping list  based on what you have and what you are missing 
from a recipe. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking the app should allow you to make them public so anyone can access them.
